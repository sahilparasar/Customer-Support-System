# 🎫 Smart Customer Support System (NLP Mini-Project)


## 📌 Project Overview
This project is an **End-to-End NLP Pipeline** designed to automate customer support operations. The system analyzes incoming support tickets to perform two simultaneous tasks:
1.  **Topic Classification:** Determines if the issue is related to *Billing*, *Tech Support*, or *General Inquiry*.
2.  **Sentiment Analysis:** Detects if the customer is *Happy*, *Neutral*, or *Angry*.

Based on these two factors, the system intelligently routes the ticket and assigns a priority level (e.g., escalating angry customers immediately).

## 📊 Evaluation & Results

The system evaluates performance using Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
